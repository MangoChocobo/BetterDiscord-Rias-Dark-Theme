# BetterDiscord Rias Dark Theme

A theme I made using the css template from [ClearVision](https://github.com/ClearVision).

I just edited it to my liking and added something that a degenerate weeb like myself could enjoy since I have Discord open all the time :)

This is temporary until I finish writing my main css file to use. until then I'll use the CV teams one.
